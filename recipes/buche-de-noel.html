        <h1>Buche De Noel</h1>
        <p>"Buche de Noel" is the French name for a Christmas cake shaped like a log. This one is a heavenly flourless chocolate cake rolled with chocolate whipped cream and decorated with confectioners' sugar to resemble snow on a yule log. It doesn't just look beautiful â€” it tastes wonderful, too!</p>
